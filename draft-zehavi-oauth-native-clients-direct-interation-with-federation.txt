    OAuth 2.0 direct interation for native clients using federation
draft-zehavi-oauth-native-clients-direct-interation-with-federation-latest

Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 for First-Party Applications (FiPA)
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] defined a native OAuth 2.0 *direct
   interaction*, whereby clients call authorization server's _Native
   Authorization Endpoint_ as an HTTP REST API, whose response instructs
   client what information to collect from end-user to satisfy
   authorization server's policies and requirements.

   While FiPA [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] focused on a one-to-one
   relationship between client and authorization server, this document
   is an *extension profile* adding support for authorization servers to
   federate the interaction to a downstream authorization server,
   instruct collection of additional information from users to guide
   request routing or instruct the usage of another native app for user
   interaction.

1.  Introduction

   This document, OAuth 2.0 direct interation for native clients using
   federation, extends FiPA [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] to enable
   federation based flows, while retaining client's direct interaction
   with end-user.

   The client calls the _Native Authorization Endpoint_ as an HTTP REST
   API, and receives instructions via the protocol established by FiPA,
   guiding client to interact with downstream authorization servers.
   This establishes a multi authorization server federated flow, whose
   user interactions are driven by the client app.

   This document extends FiPA [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] with new
   error responses: federate, redirect_to_app, insufficient_information
   and native_authorization_federate_unsupported.

   It also adds additional response parameters: federation_uri,
   federation_body, response_uri, deep_link.

   And adds the native_callback_uri request parameter.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

   There are three primary ways this specification extends FiPA:

   *  federate response: Sends the client to interact with a downstream
      authorization server.

   *  insufficient_information response: Instructs the client to collect
      information from end-user required to decide where to federate to.
      For example this could be an email address which identifies the
      trust domain.

   *  redirect_to_app: Instructs the client to natively invoke an app to
      interact with end user.

3.1.  Representative flow: Native client federated and redirected to app

   Figure: Native client federated, then redirected to app

   *  (A) The client starts the flow.

   *  (B) The client initiates the authorization request by making a
      POST request to the Native Authorization Endpoint of Authorization
      Server 1.

   *  (C) Authorization Server 1 decides to federate the user to
      Authorization Server 2.  To do so it contacts Authorization Server
      2's PAR [RFC9126] endpoint, then returns the federate error code
      together with the _federation_uri_, _federation_body_,
      _response_uri_ and _auth_session_ response attributes.

   *  (D) The client calls Authorization Server 2's Native Authorization
      Endpoint, as instructed by Authorization Server 1.

   *  (E) Authorization Server 2 decides to use a native app, and
      therefore responds with the redirect_to_app error code together
      with the _deep_link_ response attribute.

   *  (F) The client invokes the app using the deep_link.

   *  (G) The app interacts with user and if satisifed, returns an
      authorization code, regarded as Authorization Server 2's response
      to Authorization Server 1's federation to it.

   *  (H) The client provides the authorization code to Authorization
      Server 1.

   *  (I) Authorization Server 1 returns an authorization code.

   *  (J) The client sends the authorization code received in step (I)
      to obtain a token from the Token Endpoint.

   *  (K) Authorization Server 1 returns an Access Token from the Token
      Endpoint.

4.  Protocol Endpoints

4.1.  Native Authorization Endpoint

   The native authorization endpoint defined by FiPA
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] is used by this document.

   This document adds the _native_callback_uri_ parameter to the native
   authorization endpoint, to support native user navigation across
   apps.

   Before an authorization server instructs a client to federate to a
   downstream authorization server, it SHALL ensure the federated
   authorization server offers a _native_authorization_endpoint_,
   otherwise return the error
   _native_authorization_federate_unsupported_.

   When federating to downstream authorization servers, the usage of PAR
   [RFC9126] with client authentication is REQUIRED, because when the
   client interacting with end-user calls the federated authorization
   server, it is not *its* OAuth client and therefore has no other means
   of authenticating.  When using PAR with client authentication, the
   request_uri provided to the Native Authorization Endpoint attests
   that client authentication (by the federating authorization server)
   took place.

4.2.  Native Authorization Request

   The native authorization endpoint is called as defined by FiPA
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps].  This document adds the following
   request parameter:

   "native_callback_uri":  OPTIONAL.  Native client app's
      *redirect_uri*, claimed as deep link. _native_callback_uri_ SHALL
      be natively invoked by authorization server's user-interacting app
      to provide its response to the client app.  If native_callback_uri
      is included in a native authorization request, authorization
      server MUST include the native_callback_uri when federating to
      another authorization server.

4.3.  Native Authorization Response

   This document extends FiPA's [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] error
   response, by adding the following error codes:

   "error":  REQUIRED.  A single ASCII [USASCII] error code from the
      following:

      "insufficient_information":  the Authorization Server requires
         additional user input, other than an authentication challenge,
         to determine the target authorization server to federate to.
         See Section 4.3.3 for details.

      "federate":  The Authorization Server wishes to federate to
         another authorization server, which it is a client of.  This
         response MUST include the _federation_uri_ response parameter.
         See Section 4.3.1 for details.

      "redirect_to_app":  The Authorization Server wishes to fulfill the
         user interaction using another native app.  This response MUST
         include the _federation_uri_ response parameter.  See
         Section 4.3.2 for details.

      "native_authorization_federate_unsupported":  The authorization
         server intended to federate to a downstream authorization
         server, but it does not support the native authorization
         endpoint.

   And adds the following response attributes:

   "federation_uri":  OPTIONAL.  The Native Authorization Endpoint of a
      downstream authorization server to federate to.

   "deep_link":  OPTIONAL.  A URI of native app to be invoked to handle
      the request.

   "federation_body":  OPTIONAL.  A string of application/x-www-form-
      urlencoded request parameters according to this specification for
      the downstream authorization server's Native Authorization
      Endpoint.

   "response_uri":  OPTIONAL.  A URI of an endpoint of federating
      authorization server which shall receive the response from the
      federated authorization server.

4.3.1.  Federating Response

   If the authorization server decides to federate to another
   authorization server, it responds with error code _federate_ and MUST
   return the _federation_uri_, _federation_body_, _response_uri_ and
   _auth_session_ response attributes.

   When federating to another authorization server:

   *  Federating authorization server MUST use PAR [RFC9126] and include
      _request_uri_ in federation_body.

   *  If _native_callback_uri_ was included in the native authorization
      request, it MUST be included when calling federated authorization
      server's Native Authorization Endpoint.

   Example *federating* response:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "federate",
       "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
       "response_uri": "https://prev-as.com/native-authorization",
       "federation_uri": "https://next-as.com/native-authorization",
       "federation_body": "client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
         urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
   }

   Client MUST call the _federation_uri_ using HTTP POST, and provide it
   _federation_body_ as application/x-www-form-urlencoded request body.
   Example:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: next-as.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX

   The client MUST provide any response obtained from the *federated*
   authorization server, as application/x-www-form-urlencoded request
   body for the _response_uri_ of the respective *federating*
   authorization server which SHALL be invoked using HTTP POST.

   However, when *federated* authorization server returns the following
   error codes: _federate_, _insufficient_authorization_,
   _insufficient_information_, _redirect_to_app_, _redirect_to_web_,
   client MUST handle these errors according to FiPA
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] and this specification.

   Example client calling receiving an authorization code response from
   the federated authorization server:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Server: next-as.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "authorization_code": "uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY"
   }

   And providing it to the federating authorization server's
   response_uri, adding previously obtained auth_session:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: prev-as.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY
   &auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f

4.3.2.  Redirect to app response

   If the authorization server decides to nominate another native app to
   interact with end user, it responds with error code _redirect_to_app_
   and MUST return the _deep_link_ response attribute.

   Example *redirect_to_app* response:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "redirect_to_app",
       "deep_link": "https://next-as.com/native-authorization?
         client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
         urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
   }

   Client MUST use OS mechanisms to invoke the obtained deep_link.  If
   no app claiming deep_link is found on the device, client MUST
   terminate the flow and MAY attempt a normal non-native OAuth flow.

   The invoked app handles the native authorization request:

   *  Validates the request and ensures it contains a
      _native_callback_uri_, Otherwise terminates the flow.

   *  Establishes trust in _native_callback_uri_ and validates that an
      app claiming it is on the device.  Otherwise terminates the flow.

   *  Authenticates end-user and authorizes the request.

   *  Uses OS mechanisms to natively invoke _native_callback_uri_ and
      return to the client, providing it a response according to this
      specification's response from a Native Authorization Endpoint, as
      url-encoded query parameters.

   Note - trust establishment mechanisms in _native_callback_uri_ are
   out of scope of this specification.  However we assume closed
   ecosystems could employ an allowList, and open ecosystems could
   leverage [OpenID.Federation]:

   *  Extract native_callback_uri's DNS domain.

   *  Add the path /.well-known/openid-federation and perform trust
      chain resolution.

   *  Inspect client's metadata for redirect_uri's and validate
      *native_callback_uri* is included among them.

   When the client is invoked on its native_callback_uri, it shall
   regard the invocation as a response from the authorization server
   which instructed _redirect_to_app_. Therefore, obtained response's
   audience is the authorization server which federated the client to
   the authorization server which redirected the client to the app.  See
   Section 4.3.1 for details.

   Example URI used to invoke of client app on its claimed
   native_callback_uri:

   https://client.example.com/cb?authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY

   Example client invoking the response_uri *of the authorization server
   which federated it* to the authorization server, which redirected it
   to the app:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: prev-as.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY
   &auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f

4.3.3.  Additional Information Required Response

   If additional user input is required, for example to determine where
   to federate to, the response body shall contain the following
   additional properties:

   logo:  OPTIONAL.  URL or base64-encoded logo of _Authorization
      Server_, for branding purposes.

   userPrompt:  REQUIRED.  A JSON object containing the prompt
      definition.  The following parameters MAY be used:

   *  options: OPTIONAL.  A JSON object that defines a dropdown/select
      input with various options to choose from.  Each key is the
      parameter name to be sent in the response and each value defines
      the option:

      -  title: OPTIONAL.  A string holding the input's title.

      -  description: OPTIONAL.  A string holding the input's
         description.

      -  values: REQUIRED.  A JSON object where each key is the
         selection value and each value holds display data for that
         value:

         o  name: REQUIRED.  A string holding the display name of the
            selection value.

         o  logo: OPTIONAL.  A string holding a URL or base64-encoded
            image for that selection value.

   *  inputs: OPTIONAL.  A JSON object that defines an input field.
      Each key is the parameter name to be sent in the response and each
      value defines the input field:

      -  title: OPTIONAL.  A string holding the input's title.

      -  hint: OPTIONAL.  A string holding the input's hint that is
         displayed if the input is empty.

      -  description: OPTIONAL.  A string holding the input's
         description.

   Example of requesting end-user for 2 multiple-choice inputs:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "insufficient_information",
       "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
       "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo of Authorization Server",
       "userPrompt": {
           "options": {
               "bank": {
                   "title": "Bank",
                   "description": "Choose your Bank",
                   "values": {
                       "bankOfSomething": {
                           "name": "Bank of Something",
                           "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo"
                       },
                       "firstBankOfCountry": {
                           "name": "First Bank of Country",
                           "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo"
                       }
                   }
               },
               "segment": {
                   "title": "Customer Segment",
                   "description": "Choose your Customer Segment",
                   "values": {
                       "retail": "Retail",
                       "smb": "Small & Medium Businesses",
                       "corporate": "Corporate",
                       "ic": "Institutional Clients"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

   Example of requesting end-user for text input entry (email):

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "insufficient_information",
       "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
       "action": "prompt",
       "id": "request-identifier-2",
       "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo of Authorization Server",
       "userPrompt": {
           "inputs": {
               "email": {
                   "hint": "Enter your email address",
                   "title": "E-Mail",
                   "description": "Lorem Ipsum"
               }
           }
       }
   }

   The client gathers the required additional information and makes a
   POST request to the Native Authorization Endpoint.  Example of
   response following end-user multiple-choice:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.as.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f
   &bank=bankOfSomething
   &segment=retail

   Example of _Client App_ response following end-user input entry:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.as.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f
   &email=end_user@example.as.com

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Non First-Party applications of federated authorization servers

   A federated authorization server should consider end-user's privacy
   and security to determine if it should present authorization
   challenges in federation scenarios.  For example, it can label
   *federating* clients as such and avoid serving them (i.e: client's
   interacting on their behalf) authorization challenges involving
   sensitive data, as these are not first party clients.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  OAuth Parameters Registration

   IANA has (TBD) registered the following values in the IANA "OAuth
   Parameters" registry of [IANA.oauth-parameters] established by
   [RFC6749].

   *Parameter name*: native_callback_uri

   *Parameter usage location*: Native Authorization Endpoint

   *Change Controller*: IETF

   *Specification Document*: Section 5.4 of this specification

   Figure: Native client federated, then redirected to app

A.1.2.  Client makes initial request and receives "federate" error

   Client calls the native authorization endpoint and includes the
   _native_callback_uri_ parameter:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: as-1.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=t7CieSlru4&native_callback_uri=
   https://client.example.com/cb

   The first authorization server, as-1.com, decides to federate to as-
   2.com after validating it supports the native authorization endpoint.
   If it does not, as-1.com returns:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "native_authorization_federate_unsupported"
   }

   If native authorization endpoint is supported by the federated
   authorization server, as-1.com performs a PAR [RFC9126] request to
   as-2.com's pushed authorization endpoint, including the original
   _native_callback_uri_:

   POST /par HTTP/1.1
   Host: as-2.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&native_callback_uri=
   https://client.example.com/cb

   as-1.com receives a request_uri from as-2.com's PAR endpoint, which
   it includes in its response to client, in the _federation_body_
   attribute:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "federate",
       "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
       "response_uri": "https://as-1.com/native-authorization",
       "federation_uri": "https://as-2.com/native-authorization",
       "federation_body": "client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
         urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
   }

   See Section 4.3.1 for more details.

A.1.3.  Client calls federated authorization server and is redirected to
        app

   Client calls the _federation_uri_ it got from as-1.com using HTTP
   POST with _federation_body_ as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   request body:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: as-2.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX

   as-2.com decides to use its native app to interact with end-user and
   responds:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "error": "redirect_to_app",
       "deep_link": "https://as-2.com/native-authorization?
         client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
         urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
   }

   Client locates an app claiming the obtained deep_link and invokes it.
   See Section 4.3.2 for more details.  The invoked app handles the
   native authorization request and then natively invokes
   native_callback_uri:

   https://client.example.com/cb?authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY

A.1.4.  Client calls federating authorization server

   Client invokes the response_uri of as-1.com as it is the
   authorization server which federated it to as-2.com and the app's
   response is regarded as the response of as-2.com:

   POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
   Host: as-1.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY
   &auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f

   And receives in response an authorization code, which it is the
   audience of (no further federations) to resolve:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "authorization_code": "vZ3:uM3G2eHimcoSqjZ"
   }

   Client proceeds to exchange code for tokens.
