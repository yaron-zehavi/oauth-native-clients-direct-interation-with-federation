--- abstract

OAuth 2.0 for First-Party Applications (FiPA) {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} defined a native
OAuth 2.0 **direct interaction**, whereby clients call authorization server's *Native Authorization
Endpoint* as an HTTP REST API, whose response instructs client what information
to collect from end-user to satisfy authorization server's policies and requirements.

While FiPA {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} focused on a one-to-one relationship between
client and authorization server, this document is an **extension profile** adding support
for authorization servers to federate the interaction to a downstream authorization server,
instruct collection of additional information from users to guide request routing or instruct
the usage of a native app for user interaction.

--- middle

# Introduction

This document, OAuth 2.0 direct interation for native clients using federation,
extends FiPA {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} to enable federation based flows,
while retaining client's direct interaction with end-user.

The client calls the *Native Authorization Endpoint* as an HTTP REST API, and receives
instructions via the protocol established by FiPA, guiding client to interact with
downstream authorization servers. This establishes a multi authorization server
federated flow, whose user interactions are driven by the client app.

This document extends FiPA {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} with new error responses:
`federate`, `redirect_to_app`, `insufficient_information` and
`native_authorization_federate_unsupported`.

It also adds additional response parameters:
`federation_uri`, `federation_body`, `response_uri`, `deep_link`.

And adds the `native_callback_uri` request parameter.

# Conventions and Definitions

# Protocol Overview

There are three primary ways this specification extends FiPA:

* `federate` response: Sends the client to interact with a downstream authorization server.
* `insufficient_information` response: Instructs the client to collect information from end-user required to decide where to federate to. For example this could be an email address which identifies the trust domain.
* `redirect_to_app`: Instructs the client to natively invoke an app to interact with end user.

## Representative flow: Native client federated and redirected to app

Figure: Native client federated, then redirected to app

- (A) The client starts the flow.
- (B) The client initiates the authorization request by making a POST request to the Native Authorization Endpoint of Authorization Server 1.
- (C) Authorization Server 1 decides to federate the user to Authorization Server 2. To do so it contacts Authorization Server 2's PAR {{RFC9126}} endpoint, then returns the `federate` error code together with the *federation_uri*, *federation_body*, *response_uri* and *auth_session* response attributes.
- (D) The client calls Authorization Server 2's Native Authorization Endpoint, as instructed by Authorization Server 1.
- (E) Authorization Server 2 decides to use a native app, and therefore responds with the `redirect_to_app` error code together with the *deep_link* response attribute.
- (F) The client invokes the app using the deep_link.
- (G) The app interacts with user and if satisifed, returns an authorization code, regarded as Authorization Server 2's response to Authorization Server 1's federation to it.
- (H) The client provides the authorization code to Authorization Server 1.
- (I) Authorization Server 1 returns an authorization code.
- (J) The client sends the authorization code received in step (I) to obtain a token from the Token Endpoint.
- (K) Authorization Server 1 returns an Access Token from the Token Endpoint.

# Protocol Endpoints

## Native Authorization Endpoint {#native-authorization-endpoint}

The native authorization endpoint defined by FiPA {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} is used by this document.

This document adds the *native_callback_uri* parameter to the native authorization endpoint, to support
cross-app native user navigation.

Before authorization servers instruct a client to federate to a downstream authorization server, they MUST ensure it offers a *native_authorization_endpoint*, otherwise return the error native_authorization_federate_unsupported*.

When federating to downstream authorization servers, the usage of PAR {{RFC9126}} with client authentication is REQUIRED, as the native client calling the Native Authorization Endpoint of a federated authorization server is not *its* OAuth client and therefore has no other means of authenticating.
When using PAR with client authentication, the request_uri provided to the Native Authorization Endpoint attests that client authentication took place.

## Native Authorization Request {#native-auth-request}

The native authorization endpoint is called as defined by FiPA {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}}.
This document adds the following request parameter:

"native_callback_uri":
: OPTIONAL. Native client app's **redirect_uri**, claimed as deep link. *native_callback_uri* SHALL be natively invoked by authorization server's user-interacting app to provide its response to the client app. If native_callback_uri is included in a native authorization request, authorization server MUST include the native_callback_uri when federating to another authorization server.

## Native Authorization Response {#native-response}

This document extends FiPA's {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} error response,
by adding the following error codes:

"error":
:    REQUIRED.  A single ASCII {{USASCII}} error code from the following:

     "insufficient_information":
     :     the Authorization Server requires additional user input,
           other than an authentication challenge, to determine the
           target authorization server to federate to.
           See {{insufficient-information}} for details.

     "federate":
     :     The Authorization Server wishes to federate to another
           authorization server, which it is a client of. This
           response MUST include the *federation_uri* response parameter.
           See {{federating-response}} for details.

     "redirect_to_app":
     :     The Authorization Server wishes to fulfill the user interaction
           using another native app. This response MUST include the
           *federation_uri* response parameter.
           See {{redirect-to-app-response}} for details.

     "native_authorization_federate_unsupported":
     :     The authorization server intended to federate to
           a downstream authorization server, but it does not
           support the native authorization endpoint.

And adds the following response attributes:

"federation_uri":
:    OPTIONAL.  The Native Authorization Endpoint of a downstream
     authorization server to federate to.

"deep_link":
:    OPTIONAL.  A URI of native app to be invoked to handle the request.

"federation_body":
:    OPTIONAL.  A string of application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     request parameters according to this specification for the
     downstream authorization server's Native Authorization Endpoint.

"response_uri":
:    OPTIONAL.  A URI of an endpoint of federating authorization server
     which shall receive the response from the federated authorization server.

### Federating Response {#federating-response}

If the authorization server decides to federate to another authorization server, it
responds with error code *federate* and MUST return the *federation_uri*,
*federation_body*, *response_uri* and *auth_session* response attributes.

When federating to another authorization server:
* Federating authorization server MUST use PAR {{RFC9126}} and include *request_uri* in federation_body.
* If *native_callback_uri* was included in the native authorization request, it MUST be included when calling federated authorization server's Native Authorization Endpoint.

Example **federating** response:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "federate",
        "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
        "response_uri": "https://prev-as.com/native-authorization",
        "federation_uri": "https://next-as.com/native-authorization",
        "federation_body": "client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
          urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
    }

Client MUST call the *federation_uri* using HTTP POST, and provide it *federation_body*
as application/x-www-form-urlencoded request body. Example:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: next-as.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
    urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX

The client MUST provide any response obtained from the **federated** authorization server,
as application/x-www-form-urlencoded request body for the *response_uri* of the respective
**federating** authorization server which SHALL be invoked using HTTP POST.

However, when **federated** authorization server returns the following error codes:
*federate*, *insufficient_authorization*, *insufficient_information*, *redirect_to_app*,
*redirect_to_web*, client MUST handle these errors according to FiPA {{I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps}} and this specification.

Example client calling receiving an authorization code response from the federated
authorization server:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: next-as.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store

    {
      "authorization_code": "uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY"
    }

And providing it to the federating authorization server's response_uri,
adding previously obtained auth_session:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: prev-as.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY
    &auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f

### Redirect to app response {#redirect-to-app-response}

If the authorization server decides to use a native app to interact with
end user, it responds with error code *redirect_to_app* and MUST return the
*deep_link* response attribute.

Example **redirect_to_app** response:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "redirect_to_app",
        "deep_link": "https://next-as.com/native-authorization?
          client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
          urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
    }

Client MUST use OS mechanisms to invoke the obtained deep_link.
If no app claiming deep_link is found on the device, client MUST terminate the
flow and MAY attempt a normal non-native OAuth flow.

The invoked app handles the native authorization request:

* Validates the request and ensures it contains a *native_callback_uri*, Otherwise terminates the flow.
* Establishes trust in *native_callback_uri* and validates that an app claiming it is on the device. Otherwise terminates the flow.
* Authenticates end-user and authorizes the request.
* Uses OS mechanisms to natively invoke *native_callback_uri* and return to the client, providing it a response according to this specification's response from a Native Authorization Endpoint, as url-encoded query parameters.

Note - trust establishment mechanisms in *native_callback_uri* are out of scope of this specification.
However we assume closed ecosystems could employ an allowList, and open ecosystems could leverage
{{OpenID.Federation}}:

  * Extract native_callback_uri's DNS domain.
  * Add the path /.well-known/openid-federation and perform trust chain resolution.
  * Inspect client's metadata for redirect_uri's and validate **native_callback_uri** is included among them.

When the client is invoked on its native_callback_uri, it shall regard the invocation as a
response **from** the authorization server which redirected the client to the app.
In other words, this response's audience is not the authorization server which redirected
the client to the app. See {{federating-response}} for details.

Example URI used to invoke of client app on its claimed native_callback_uri:

    https://client.example.com/cb?authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY

Example client invoking the response_uri **of the authorization server which federated it**
to the authorization server, which redirected it to the app:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: **prev-as.com**
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY
    &auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f

### Additional Information Required Response {#insufficient-information}

If additional user input is required, for example to determine where to federate to,
the response body shall contain the following additional properties:

logo:
: OPTIONAL. URL or base64-encoded logo of *Authorization Server*, for branding purposes.

userPrompt:
: REQUIRED. A JSON object containing the prompt definition. The following parameters MAY be used:

- options: OPTIONAL. A JSON object that defines a dropdown/select input with various options to choose from. Each key is the parameter name to be sent in the response and each value defines the option:

  - title: OPTIONAL. A string holding the input's title.
  - description: OPTIONAL. A string holding the input's description.
  - values: REQUIRED. A JSON object where each key is the selection value and each value holds display data for that value:

    - name: REQUIRED. A string holding the display name of the selection value.
    - logo: OPTIONAL. A string holding a URL or base64-encoded image for that selection value.
- inputs: OPTIONAL. A JSON object that defines an input field. Each key is the parameter name to be sent in the response and each value defines the input field:

  - title: OPTIONAL. A string holding the input's title.
  - hint: OPTIONAL. A string holding the input's hint that is displayed if the input is empty.
  - description: OPTIONAL. A string holding the input's description.

Example of requesting end-user for 2 multiple-choice inputs:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "insufficient_information",
        "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
        "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo of Authorization Server",
        "userPrompt": {
            "options": {
                "bank": {
                    "title": "Bank",
                    "description": "Choose your Bank",
                    "values": {
                        "bankOfSomething": {
                            "name": "Bank of Something",
                            "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo"
                        },
                        "firstBankOfCountry": {
                            "name": "First Bank of Country",
                            "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo"
                        }
                    }
                },
                "segment": {
                    "title": "Customer Segment",
                    "description": "Choose your Customer Segment",
                    "values": {
                        "retail": "Retail",
                        "smb": "Small & Medium Businesses",
                        "corporate": "Corporate",
                        "ic": "Institutional Clients"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Example of requesting end-user for text input entry (email):

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "insufficient_information",
        "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
        "action": "prompt",
        "id": "request-identifier-2",
        "logo": "uri or base64-encoded logo of Authorization Server",
        "userPrompt": {
            "inputs": {
                "email": {
                    "hint": "Enter your email address",
                    "title": "E-Mail",
                    "description": "Lorem Ipsum"
                }
            }
        }
    }

The client gathers the required additional information and makes a POST request to the Native Authorization Endpoint. Example of response following end-user multiple-choice:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.as.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f
    &bank=bankOfSomething
    &segment=retail

Example of *Client App* response following end-user input entry:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.as.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f
    &email=end_user@example.as.com

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

## Non First-Party applications of federated authorization servers {#first-party-applications}

A federated authorization server should consider end-user's privacy and security
to determine if it should present authorization challenges in federation scenarios.
For example, it can label **federating** clients as such and avoid serving them
authorization challenges, as user-serving clients receiving those challenges are
not first party clients.

# IANA Considerations

Figure: Native client federated, then redirected to app

### Client makes initial request and receives "federate" error

Client calls the native authorization endpoint and includes the *native_callback_uri* parameter:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: as-1.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=t7CieSlru4&native_callback_uri=
    https://client.example.com/cb

The first authorization server, as-1.com, decides to federate to as-2.com after validating
it supports the native authorization endpoint. If it does not, as-1.com returns:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "native_authorization_federate_unsupported"
    }

If native authorization endpoint is supported by the federated authorization server,
as-1.com performs a PAR {{RFC9126}} request to as-2.com's pushed authorization endpoint,
including the original *native_callback_uri*:

    POST /par HTTP/1.1
    Host: as-2.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&native_callback_uri=
    https://client.example.com/cb

as-1.com receives a request_uri from as-2.com's PAR endpoint, which it
includes in its response to client, in the *federation_body* attribute:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "federate",
        "auth_session": "ce6772f5e07bc8361572f",
        "response_uri": "https://as-1.com/native-authorization",
        "federation_uri": "https://as-2.com/native-authorization",
        "federation_body": "client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
          urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
    }

See {{federating-response}} for more details.

### Client calls federated authorization server and is redirected to app

Client calls the *federation_uri* it got from as-1.com using HTTP POST with
*federation_body* as application/x-www-form-urlencoded request body:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: as-2.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
    urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX

as-2.com decides to use its native app to interact with end-user and responds:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": "redirect_to_app",
        "deep_link": "https://as-2.com/native-authorization?
          client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&request_uri=
          urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:R3p_hzwsR7outNQSKfoX"
    }

Client locates an app claiming the obtained deep_link and invokes it.
See {{redirect-to-app-response}} for more details.
The invoked app handles the native authorization request and then natively invokes native_callback_uri:

    https://client.example.com/cb?authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY

### Client calls federating authorization server

Client invokes the response_uri of as-1.com as it is the authorization server which federated
it to as-2.com and the app's response is regarded as the response of as-2.com:

    POST /native-authorization HTTP/1.1
    Host: as-1.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    authorization_code=uY29tL2F1dGhlbnRpY
    &auth_session=ce6772f5e07bc8361572f

And receives in response an authorization code, which it is the audience of (no further federations) to resolve:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "authorization_code": "vZ3:uM3G2eHimcoSqjZ"
    }

Client proceeds to exchange code for tokens.
